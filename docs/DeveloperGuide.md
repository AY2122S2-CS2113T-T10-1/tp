## Design
### Architecture
![Application Diagram Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/ArchitectureDiagram.drawio.png)

The *Architecture Diagram* shown above illustrates the high-level design of the SplitLah application.

**Overview of components**
* `SplitLah [Main]`
    * On app launch: Creates an instance of a `Manager` and runs the command loop.
* `Manager`
    * On creation: Initializes the Profile, TextUI and Storage components.
    * On run: Loads data from `Storage`, receives user input from UI and uses `Parser` to parse user input into application.
* `Profile`
    * Handles cached data within run time of application. Manages and stores the list of `session` 
      that were created by the user before storing it into `Storage`.
* `TextUI`
    * Handles UI operations of the application.
* `Storage`
    * Handles storage operations of the application.
* `Parser`
    * Handles input parsing and determines which command to run.
* `Command`
    * Defines how a command is executed.

**Interaction between components**
![Component Interaction Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/ComponentInteraction.drawio.png)
<br>
The *Component Interaction Diagram* shows the inner workings of how each component in SplitLah interacts.
The diagram depicts a scenario when a user attempts to create a session.



### SplitLah Component
![SplitLah Component Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/SplitLahComponent.drawio.png)
<br>
The `SplitLah` component is the application's main class. Its job is to initialize an instance of `Manager` when the
application starts. After initialization, it would then proceed to run a loop which would prompt the user for a 
command. When it receives a command from the user, it would invoke the `parser` and retrieve the command for SplitLah
to run. Upon using the `Exit` command, SplitLah would then exit from the command loop and end the application.


### Manager Component
![Manager Component Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/ManagerComponent.drawio.png)
<br>
The `Manager` class is initialized by the `SplitLah` class (the main class) when the application starts.
It stores the `Profile`, `TextUI` and `Storage` objects. The `Profile` class helps to manage all data accesses 
throughout the lifetime of the application. While the `Storage` helps to save what the `Profile` class has captured. 
The `TextUI` class serves as an interface to read user inputs and print application outputs.

### Profile Component
![Profile Component Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/Profile%20Component.drawio.png)
<br>
The `Profile` class holds the list of sessions and groups that have been created by the user. 
It also tracks the unique identifier for `Session`, `Activity` and `Group` classes. The `Profile`
class would return a unique identifier every time a new `Session`, `Activity` or `Group` is created. 

### TextUI Component
![TextUI Component Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/TextUI%20Component.drawio.png)
<br>
The `TextUI` class is initialized by the `Manager` class when the application starts.
It stores a `Scanner` and `PrintStream` object supplied upon initialization to read and write to the user interface.
It offers methods to print application output to and read user input from these objects for other classes to use.
As TextUI handles all input and output streams, these streams can be changed without affecting the rest of the program.

### Storage Component

### Parser Component
![Parser Component Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/ParserComponent.drawio.png)
<br>
The `Parser` component consists of the `Parser` class, `ParserUtils` class as well as the `ParserErrors` class.<br>
The `Parser` class provides utility methods to parse commands and arguments from the user and
return a `Command` object representing an instruction that the user has for SplitLah.
`Parser` class is the only class in the `Parser` component that other external classes interact with.<br>
On the other hand, the `ParserUtils` class provide supporting methods for `Parser` class to properly run,
and `ParserErrors` class provide methods to produce custom error messages for the `Parser` component.

<!-- Insert Sequence Diagram -->

The general workflow of the `Parser` component is as follows:
1. When required to parse for a command, an input String object is passed to the `Parser#getCommand()` method.
2. The `Parser#getCommandType()` method is then called to decide what command is to be carried out given the input from the user.
3. Then, `Parser#getRemainingArgument()` method is run to extract the arguments from the user input.
4. The arguments are then passed to the specified `XYZCommand#prepare()` method if there are any arguments. 
Otherwise, the constructor is called. Either methods will result in the creation of a new `XYZCommand` object. 
(`XYZCommand` is a placeholder for specific subclass of the `Command` class, e.g. `SessionCreateCommand`)
5. The created `XYZCommand` object is then returned by `Parser#getCommand()` method.

### Command Component

## Implementation

### Add a session
**API reference:** [`SessionCreateCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/command/SessionCreateCommand.java)

The sequence diagram below models the interactions between various entities in the system
when the user invokes the `session /create` command.
<br>
<br>
![Create Session Sequence Diagram Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/SessionCreateCommand.drawio.png)
<br>
<br>
The general workflow of the `session /create` command is as follows:

### Remove a session
### View a session
### List sessions
**API reference:** [`SessionListCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/command/SessionListCommand.java)

The sequence diagram below models the interactions between various entities in the system
when the user invokes the `session /list` command.
<br>
<br>
![List Sessions Sequence Diagram Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/SessionListCommand.drawio.png)
<br>
<br>
The general workflow of the `session /list` command is as follows:
1. The user input provided is passed to `Splitlah`.
2. `Splitlah` then parses the input by using methods in the `Parser` class to obtain a `SessionListCommand` object.
3. `SessionListCommand#run` method is then invoked to run the `session /list` command.
4. The list of sessions are stored in a `Profile` object, hence `Manager#getProfile` is called.
5. To retrieve the sessions from profile, `Profile#getSessionList` is executed,
   where a list of `Session` objects are returned.
6. Once the list is retrieved, `SessionListCommand` class checks if the list is empty.
  1. If the list is empty, a message indicating that the list is empty is printed
     using `TextUi#printlnMessage`.
  2. If the list is not empty, `SessionListCommand` will loop from the first to the second last session,
     calling `TextUi#printlnMessage()` to print out a brief overview of each session.
     Then, the last group is printed with a divider below it, using the method `TextUi#printlnMessageWithDivider()`.

### Settle a session
### Add an activity
### Remove an activity
### View an activity
### List activities
### Add a group
**API reference:** [`GroupCreateCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/command/GroupCreateCommand.java)

The sequence diagram below models the interactions between various entities in the system
when the user invokes the `group /create` command.
<br>
<br>
![Create Group Sequence Diagram Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/GroupCreateCommand.drawio.png)
<br>
<br>
The general workflow of the `group /create` command is as follows:
1. The user input provided is passed to `Splitlah`.
2. `Splitlah` then parses the input by using methods in the `Parser` class to obtain a `GroupCreateCommand` object.
3. `GroupCreateCommand#prepare` method is then invoked to obtain the group name and name list of people involved in the group. 
    A new GroupCreateCommand object will be returned if both were found in the group, an InvalidCommand otherwise.
4. If a GroupCreateCommand object is returned, `GroupCreateCommand#run` method is invoked to run the `group /create` command.
5. Once the command starts to run, `GroupCreateCommand`class checks if there are duplicates in the name list 
6. If there are duplicates, a message indicating that name list contains duplicates is printed using `TextUi#printlnMessage`. 
7. If there are no duplicates, `GroupCreateCommand` class converts each of the names into a `Person` object.
8. `GroupCreateCommand` class then checks whether there are existing groups with the group name.
9. If existing groups with the group name are found, a message indicating that another group with the same name is printed using `TextUi#printlnMessage`
10. If no existing groups with the group name are found, `GroupCreateCommand` class generates a new groupId and create a new `Group` object using the group name, name list, and groupId. 
11. The list of `Group` object are managed by a `Profile` object, hence `Manager#getProfile#addGroup` is called to store the Group object in the Profile.
12. The `GroupCreateCommand` class prints a message indicating that a group is successfully created and stored in `Parser` class.

### Remove a group
### View a group
### List groups
**API reference:** [`GroupListCommand.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/command/GroupListCommand.java)

The sequence diagram below models the interactions between various entities in the system
when the user invokes the `group /list` command.
<br>
<br>
![List Groups Sequence Diagram Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/GroupListCommand.drawio.png)
<br>
<br>
The general workflow of the `group /list` command is as follows:
1. The user input provided is passed to `Splitlah`.
2. `Splitlah` then parses the input by using methods in the `Parser` class to obtain a `GroupListCommand` object.
3. `GroupListCommand#run()` method is then invoked to run the `group /list` command.
4. The list of groups are stored in a `Profile` object, hence `Manager#getProfile()` is called
before the list of groups can be retrieved.
5. To retrieve the groups from the profile retrieved, `Profile#getGroupList()` method is executed,
where a list of `Group` objects are returned.
6. Once the list is retrieved, `GroupListCommand` class checks if the list is empty.
   1. If the list is empty, a message indicating that the list is empty is printed
   using the method `TextUi#printlnMessage()`.
   2. If the list is not empty, `GroupListCommand` will loop from the first to the second last group, 
   calling `TextUi#printlnMessage()` to print out the summary of each group.
   Then, the last group is printed with a divider below it, using the method `TextUi#printlnMessageWithDivider()`.

## Product scope
### Target user profile
* Budget conscious.
* Prefers to use desktop applications over other types of applications.
* Are able to type relatively fast.
* Comfortable using CLI applications.

### Value proposition
SplitLah will help the user keep track of expenditures made during each group outing that they go on and help the user 
calculate what transactions that they should make in order to ensure that everyone pays equally for the activities that 
they engage in during the outings.
