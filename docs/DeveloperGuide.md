## Design
### Architecture
![Application Diagram Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122s2-cs2113t-t10-1/tp/master/docs/images/developerguide/ArchitectureDiagram.drawio.png)

The *Architecture Diagram* shown above illustrates the high-level design of the SplitLah application.

**Overview of components**
* `Main`
    * On app launch: Creates an instance of `Manager` and runs command loop.
* `Manager`
    * On creation: Initializes the Profile, TextUI and Storage components.
    * On run: Loads data from `Storage`, receives user input from UI and uses `Parser` to parse user input into application.
* `Profile`
    * Handles cached data within run time of application. Manages and stores the list of `session` 
      that were created by the user before storing it into `Storage`.
* `TextUI`
    * Handles UI operations of the application.
* `Storage`
    * Handles storage operations of the application.
* `Parser`
    * Handles input parsing and determines which command to run.
* `Command`
    * Defines how a command is executed.

**Interaction between components**

## User Stories

|Version| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ...|
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|
|v1.0|new user|see usage instructions|refer to them when I forget how to use the application|
|v2.0|user|find a to-do item by name|locate a to-do without having to go through the entire list|
