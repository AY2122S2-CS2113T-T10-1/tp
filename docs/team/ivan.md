## Project - SplitLah
<hr>
SplitLah is a Command Line (CLI) program that is written in Java and meant to run on `Java 11` . SplitLah is an 
application for keeping track of expenses during group outing sessions, specifically for those 
who are budget conscious. It then proceeds to split the expenses according to the group members' individual costs for 
the activities they participated in, for a particular session.
