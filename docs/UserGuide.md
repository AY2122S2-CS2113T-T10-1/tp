# SplitLah
SplitLah is a desktop app with a Command Line Interface (CLI) for **splitting bills** amongst you and your friends after a group outing,
where each group outing can consist of several activities with **different people paying the bill** for each activity.
SplitLah does the work of **calculating how much each participant owes** and whom they must pay at the end of the activity.
You will no longer have to waste time doing these calculations by hand, leaving you with more time to spend with your
friends.

SplitLah also **consolidates all debts intelligently** so that they can be paid off with the fewest number of transactions 
possible, helping you to **reduce time spent on making pointless transactions**. 
You can **look up past activities** anytime you want. SplitLah remembers your information by saving your outings and
activities.
If you can type fast, SplitLah can manage your outings faster than apps using a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Who SplitLah is for:
- People who go on group outings often and love to split bills.
- People who dislike manually calculating how much people owe across several activities.
- People who go on group outings where different people pay for different activities, making bill-splitting harder.
- People who want to manage outings with multiple social circles in one application.
- People who can type fast.

## How to use this user guide
- For each feature that SplitLah supports, we refer it as commands.
- We classify each command under 5 sections, [Session Management](#session-management), [Activity Management](#activity-management), 
[Transaction Management](#transaction-management), [Group Management](#group-management) and [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous).
- Each command is explained in greater detail in each command section.
- The format for each command and examples are encased within a `code block`, so that they can be copied directly into SplitLah if needed.
  - Example: `help`
- In each command: 
  - The blocks indicated with üí° are important things to take note of when using the command.
  - The blocks indicated with ‚ö†Ô∏èare warnings that you should pay attention to when using the command.

## Quick Notes

    - Alphanumeric characters: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`
    - Decimals: `3.5`
    - Whitespace: `Birthday party`
- A forward slash `/` indicates a delimiter and is used to separate commands into parts.
  Each command's documentation specifies the required delimiters and their purpose.
    - Example: `/n`, `/sid`
- Parameters enclosed in `[ ]` must be supplied by the user.
    - Example: `[SESSION_ID]`
- Parameters with an ellipsis `...` indicate that the user can supply multiple values.
    - Example: `[COST1 COST2 ...]`
- Parameters enclosed within `[<` and `>]` indicates that the arguments are optional.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest .jar version of SplitLah from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/releases)
3. Copy the file to the folder you wish to use as a home folder for SplitLah.
4. Start SplitLah by executing `java -jar SplitLah.jar` in the terminal.
5. Type in a command and press Enter to execute it.
6. Refer to Features for a more in-depth explanation of all commands available.

## How SplitLah works
- An activity represents a single group activity, paid for by one person. An activity stores a list of its participants,
the payer and how much each participant owes.
  - Example: `Lunch at a restaurant`
  - Consisting of the following participants:
    - `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`
  - Paid for by:
    - `Alice`
- A session represents a period of time and stores one or more activities, as well as a list of participants. Each
activity could have a different payer.
  - Example: `Bob's birthday`
  - Consisting of the following participants:
    - `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`
  - Consisting of the following activities:
    - `Breakfast at McDonald's`, `Lunch at a restaurant`, `Movie at a theatre`
    - Each paid for by a different person.
- At the end of a session, SplitLah calculates how much each person owes and who they need to pay. This information is
displayed in an easy-to-read summary.

## Features 

## _Session Management_
> A session represents a group outing spanning an arbitrary period of time containing one or more activities.

<br>

### Creating a session: `session /create`
Creates a session so that you can manage your group outings using SplitLah. <br>

> Format: `session /create /n [SESSION_NAME] /d [SESSION_DATE] /pl [NAME1 NAME2 ...] [</gid [GROUD_ID]>]`
>* `[SESSION_NAME]` refers to the name of the session.
>  * The session name is **case-insensitive**.
>* `[SESSION_DATE]` refers to the date of the session.
>  * The format of the date must be in `DD-MM-YYYY`.

> 
> **‚ö†Ô∏èWarnings:**
>- When using `/pl` and `/gid` delimiters together, if there is a duplicated name in `/pl` and 
   specified group with `/gid`. The duplicate name would be removed, storing only 1 instance of it.
>- Example: Where the group specified by `/gid` consists of Alice and Bob and the arguments of `/pl` 
   includes Alice, only two names, Alice and Bob, would be saved.

<br>

**Example 1** 
- Adds a new session named Class Outing with Alice and Bob involved on 15-03-2022.<br><br>
  `session /create /n Class Outing /d 15-03-2022 /pl Alice Bob` <br><br>
