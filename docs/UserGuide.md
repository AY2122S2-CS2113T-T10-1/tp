## Introduction

SplitLah is a CLI program that lets users split bills proportionally amongst themselves after a group outing. SplitLah does
the work of calculating how much each participant must pay across multiple activities, and keeps track of who paid the total
bill for each activity.

Value proposition:

- Allows users to keep track of several activities and their participants.
- Splits costs evenly or independently depending on what is required.
- Combines all payments due together for easy settlement of payments.
- Can be operated quickly by an experienced typist.

Target users:

- People who go on group outings often and split bills.
- People who dislike manually calculating how much people owe across several activities.
- People who go on group outings where different people pay for different activities, making bill-splitting harder.

## How SplitLah works
- An activity represents a single group activity, paid for by one person. An activity stores a list of its participants,
the payer and how much each participant owes.
  - Example: `Lunch at a restaurant`
  - Consisting of the following participants:
    - `Warren`, `Ivan`, `Roy`
  - Paid for by:
    - `Warren`
- A session represents a period of time and stores one or more activities, as well as a list of participants. Each
activity could have a different payer.
  - Example: `Ivan's birthday`
  - Consisting of the following participants:
    - `Warren`, `Ivan`, `Roy`
  - Consisting of the following activities:
    - `Breakfast at McDonald's`, `Lunch at a restaurant`, `Movie at a theatre`
    - Each paid for by a different person.
- At the end of a session, SplitLah calculates how much each person owes and who they need to pay. This information is
displayed in an easy-to-read summary.

## Quick Notes
- Allowed characters for values:
    - Alphanumeric characters: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`
    - Decimals: `3.5`
    - Whitespace: `Birthday party`
- A forward slash `/` indicates a delimiter and is used to separate commands into parts.
  Each command's documentation specifies the required delimiters and their purpose.
  - Example: `/n`, `/sid`
- Parameters enclosed in [ ] must be supplied by the user. 
  - Example: `[SESSION_ID]`
- Parameters with an ellipsis `...` indicate that the user can supply multiple values.
  - Example: `[COST1] [COST2] ...`
